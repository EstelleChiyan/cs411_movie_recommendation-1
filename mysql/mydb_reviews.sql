INSERT INTO `reviews` VALUES (119,'I\'m at a total loss. I do reviews for friends and family and I\'m notorious for giving C+ movies a good review because of some redeeming quality I found in the story, characters-- even good special effects could put something over the top (but people would know why i rated something well). This really doesn\'t stand out for any reason, whatsoever. I\'ve read a dozen reviews trying to just understand why it\'s rated so high. The actors were confined to a limited script, and the directing was awful (they did not deserve to include the homage to, e.g., Big). The story, which was already staked out in the graphic novels, was contrived and awkward, here, with a couple of interesting, well-handled devices like the subway ride.But the whole thing felt like it was TV, except TV, today, is often better. If you have kids and looking for a safe movie, see it with them--it\'s fine for them. If there is a redeeming value it\'s the prolonged commercial for foster care and the terrible if artbitrary reasons for which we care for or neglect children. That was handled ok.','2019-04-10',0,0),(120,'So, I had hoped this was going to be a good movie and parts of it we\'re but other parts weren\'t.First off, while the movie had very strong family elements I wouldn\'t take my children at all. There villain\'s almost added a element of horror to the film. One specific scene 7 demons are unleashed upon a board room of people. One of the demons lifts a guy up bites his head off then throws him out the window. This scene lasts for a while as you hear and see people begging for their lives as the demons kill them one by one. This would have definitely disturbed elementary school me. Also the main character Billy Batson has had a character change from comic to film. What I mean is, I really didn\'t like how they made him much more selfish during most of this movie. I personally like the fact that he is a good kid that tries to always do the right thing. Now for this story I see how they used this character flaw to help him overcome it in the end making him a true hero after all but I would have come up with a different character flaw to overcome.Last and my biggest hurdle to try to overcome, I did not and do not like the actor they picked to play Shazam/Captain Marvel. First off, the character had to use a muscle suit in order to look buff. Second the over all look and behavior of the actor killed it for me, I couldn\'t take him seriously. He reminded me to much of Jimmy Fallon throughout the whole film who even though is a funny guy does not fit the bill to play this hero. I just couldn\'t get behind the character.I wanted to like this one cause personally I really like the character from the comics but this movie fell short for me.','2019-04-10',0,1),(121,'Weird seing a movie like this in the cinema.

Zachary Levi and Jack Dylan Grazer have great onscreen chemistry.Shazam falls prey to the superhero formula towards the third act with a one-dimensional villain played by Mark Strong who does his best with what he\'s given. The film also felt overlong with both the opening and finale feeling dragged out making the chewy nougat center feel sadly short lived.Still, I had a ton of fun with this, the humor is on point and the earnestness of the core message smoothes out the rough edges of the presentation.','2019-04-16',0,4),(124,'Terrible movie bad acting by brie larson and a lot of sexist comments from her before hand throw the whole movie away if a guy made these comments he\'d have lost his job','2019-03-09',1,0),(125,'Characters - Were boring and forgettable. Cinematography - Had one good shot and the rest of the film was basicNick Fury - Made as a joke, unintelligent and pointlessCaptain Marvel - No tension felt for her as she is overpowered and emotionless. And learns nothing throughout this film and is still the same arrogant character.Writing - The writing was dreadful and missed emotional opportunities to really make us feel for the characters, it felt like a child written it.Brie Larson - The wrong person casted as this character. She\'s a good actor, don\'t get me wrong but she wasn\'t the correct person for the job but she did well with what she was given.I had such high hopes for when I first heard about this movie but the character being basically invincible was boring and I learned nothing new from this film. As an MCU film, it also brought nothing new to the table, it didn\'t feel like it\'s own movie it felt like a mix between Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor Ragnarok.','2019-04-01',1,1),(126,'Movie was okay. Wasn\'t an overwhelming political agenda and the acting was very well done! Brie Larson and Sam L. Jackson had good chemistry throughout and their scenes together were enjoyable. Unfortunately the 2nd third of the movie was very slow and uneventful. But my biggest issue with the movie was the unnecessary tie ins with other movies in the MCU. Without giving too much away, we learn things that (one) nobody was asking for, and (two) the answers are more of a disservice and disrespectful to fans of both the comics and MCU as a whole. The source of Captain Marvel\'s power seems to break the timeline of an important item in the MCU and there\'s little to no character arc in her story. This would have been a great movie if it was by itself. But because of it\'s influence on a greater universe of connected movies, it made me more upset at betrayed than entertained.','2019-03-09',1,3),(127,'The worst marvel movie since the second Thor . I\'m giving it this low score to out weight the sjws. I hope endgame is good','2019-04-01',1,4),(128,'Visually stunning, but the story comes off poorly. It is one deus ex machina after another, driving the plot in an attempt to wrap up the trilogy loose ends, but even that doesn\'t work that well. The result is a rushed mess at times. A lot of questions about the world that these characters live in never got answered, or were written off with a couple of cheap lines. I can appreciate what Dean Deblois was trying to do, aiming for that bittersweet ending, but it came at the sacrifice of a lot of character development, as well as doing a complete 180 on the entire franchise foundations of the forever friendship by pitting one form of love against another.We don\'t even get to see another Night Fury, which was one of the biggest teases of the franchise. Instead we get a Light Fury, which is NOT a female Night Fury (per the director). It\'s a different subspecies. That means toothless species is effectively extinct, Night Furies are gone from the world which creates an unnecessary depressing twist.','2019-03-09',2,0),(129,'So very poor. With repetative and nonsensical storylines. Rampant dragonphilia. Toothless gets another upgrade pulled out of thin air. They continued with that alpha, dragon-king nonsense, despite toothless not having hypnotic powers. They add to its ridiculousness with some magic mind-control venom.They find a hidden undergorund world where magically there\'s sunligh. And lots of dragons. And apparently they feed on nothing at all. Of course toothless instantly becomes king and the other dragons bow... Even the Alpha from the second movie. Of course all dragons need to hide there, for some reason...Such a steep downhill from the first movie to the third. It was painful to watch. It has no sense or palatable story. Only cheaply constructed sentimentalism (dragons good, humans bad), beast love, and equally cheap human romance.At the end they apparently stayed at a remote unfamiliar island, instead of going home for no reason...Toothless apparently learnt to fix its mechanical tail on its own BTW.','2019-04-01',2,1),(130,'I saw a preview screening today. It was a satisfying end to this series. Some of the secondary characters, who have been annoying from the beginning, seemed especially so in this installment. But overall the story wasn\'t as repetitive as it could have been and the ending brought good maturation to Hiccup as well as toothless. I don\'t see any place to give it a star rating, but I plan to go back','2019-03-09',2,2),(131,'A gorgeously animated movie but the plot was lacking, seeming to reuse the same plot of the second film with a less compelling villain. While there were several interesting moments in the film with beautiful visuals, it seemed like the movie never really got started before ending.','2019-04-01',2,3),(132,'This movie was TERRIBLE. I didn\'t see the need for this company to create a third one when it would\'ve ended just as well if it stopped at the second movie. Also, adding another night fury just defeated the purpose of Toothless being special (and finding Toothless a mate was really unnecessary IMO) Anyway, this movie flopped and I really hope they stop here and never make a fourth coming one.','2019-03-09',2,4),(133,'The movie fails to be exceptional in any way, but neither does it have any glaring flaws. It reads exactly as it was meant to: a farewell love letter to a beloved animated series. It\'s a positive, conclusive end and I would recommend any fan of HotYD see it at least once.','2019-04-01',2,5),(134,'Technicaly it\'s the weakest of the trilogy but I thought the movie was still entertaining enough. I enjoyed Anya Taylor Joy, James macavoy, Miss Paulson, Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson. In that order I\'ve seen enough independent movies I\'m used to the ending not being the conventional, climatic ending that big studio moves requires','2019-01-27',3,3),(135,'Not a fan of the Superhero/Marvel type movies. Thinking this was going to tie in well with Split I was very disappointed. Split by far was an amazing movie! I don\'t know what this was. Sorry once they brought in the comic crap I lost interest. To end on a happy note,there were a few good moments. I did like the actors and I do love the characters, especially Hedwig!','2019-02-03',3,2),(136,'What the hell?! I\'m so disappointed in this movie. I\'d have to say apart from James McAvoy\'s stunning body and amazing split-personality performance, there wasn\'t much going on. Such a bore.','2019-01-19',3,5),(137,'Escape Room is a middling January movie with some thrilling moments punctured by a very weak story and okay characters hampered by mostly bad acting. The acting is pretty much flaming garbage except for Deborah Ann Woll (you may recognize her as Karen Page from Daredevil); however I do like most of the way the characters were portrayed. The escape rooms are unpredictable and do provide some very exciting actions. What I didn\'t like was that I felt like the plot was weak, culminating in a terrible ending to the movie. I think this is an excellent choice for a Saturday night Redbox rental in the future.','2019-01-06',5,1),(138,'While the acting is OK and the majority of the escape room scenes themselves are entertaining, the characters are still easily hateable in the last 20 minutes of the film destroy any enjoyment you might have had throughout the previous hour and 20 minutes. Over all, as the start to a new year, Escape Room is not the best first step.','2019-01-08',5,5),(139,'A movie you\'ve seen over 10 times before, and alot better most of those times. Ending with a full 15 minutes or so extra to set up a sequal didn\'t help leaving the theatre in a slightly more forgiving mood.','2019-01-19',5,4),(140,'Terrible acting and the special effects were an abomination as was the story line.','2019-04-18',5,2),(141,'To be rank, this movie is awful. But it\'s gloriously awful - I had so much fun watching it and found a lot of it to be extremely hilarious. It\'s awful because it wasn\'t supposed to be a comedy, but the amount of laughter I got from this movie made it worth seeing. It\'s fascinating how they took Disney\'s shortest \'full length\' feature and turned it into their longest live action remake yet. The entire plot of the animated movie is done by the end of the first act and from there things go full Tim Burton. If you love Dumbo and are looking for a loyal adaptation, or even just a respectful adaptation, this probably won\'t sit well with you. But if you already have low to no expectations, I think you\'ll have a good time.','2019-01-06',6,0),(142,'A charming family that had absolutely no soul to it. I was ready to forgive the live action for taking over the magic of 2d but by removing many of the star animals from the original and entirely removing their voices, there was little left to love. The musical composition gave nods to the original score without properly embracing it. Like they were dancing around it but didn\'t want to commit to making the music a feature of the movie. All in all a movie that the kids will likely enjoy without realising the magic of the original that they\'re missing out on.','2019-01-08',6,3),(143,'The storyline was so-so. Didn\'t have those wow scene. I wish the script could be more interesting. However, the creation of dumbo is excellent. It looks so real! The eyes are full of emotions. The acting part isn\'t that impressive.','2019-01-19',6,4),(144,'Horrible. Complete trainwreck. The worst movie I have ever seen. This movie sucks. It\'s very bad. So bad. Stupidly bad.

When I first heard how many characters would be in this film I was skeptical if it would be any good but that wasn\'t an issue. If I could change anything it would have been to slow down the pace and split up the content into 2 seperate movies because the lore and the setup and conflict escalation comes at you like a firehose. Definitely a must see in the theaters','2018-11-06',7,0),(147,'How good this movie actually is kinda depends on whether or not Endgame sticks the landing. This ends unresolved and if they just hit a giant reset button in endgame then all the crucial character development in this movie will be moot. But for what it is worth, the Thanos vs Iron Man showdown is the accumulation of a decade of build up and it is worth it. Seeing all the new interactions are a lot of fun, but the it all comes down to the guy with whom we started this journey. RDJ is the foundation the Tony throwing down in futile struggle against the Mad Titan was spectacular.','2018-05-08',7,4),(148,'Avengers: Infinity War (2018) isn\'t flawless, but it sure is one hell of a ride! It\'s an emotional rollercoaster of excitement, thrills, laughs, and gasps that will leave the audience stunned, and wanting more. The film attempts to balance its large ensemble of talented cast members and does so with incredible focus and cohesion. Some of our beloved heroes take a back seat on this one, giving the spotlight to the highly-anticipated purple supervillain, Thanos. Josh Brolin\'s motion-capture performance is extremely captivating, and the incredible attention to detail on the intricate expressions and modeling of the fully-CGI character is breath-taking to behold. Thanos is easily one of the best and memorable villains in a comic book film ever. Tons of surprises for die-hard MCU fans! Great character interactions, spectacular action sequences, and the stakes are higher than it\'s ever been before. Alan Silvestri\'s score truly elevates the film\'s grandeur and seamlessly weaves the frequent shifts in tone. Infinity War is a cinematic event that no one should miss.','2018-05-19',7,5),(149,'Helllboy is terribly incompetent. The plot is pointless, characters have no depth, the humor sucks, cg sucks, editing is garabge and it\'s so painfully edgy with it\'s excessive gore and language to the point where it\'s almost self aware ( almost being the key word) however tje action is fairly enjoyable and theres a few interesting shot but thats about it.

But god, this movies is just badly written with no really plot holding together and bad acting from pretty much every actor.','2019-04-18',10,2),(155,'So much better and more fun than it has any right to be. Unlike Bay\'s five previous forays into this world Bumblebee feels tighter, with more coherent action and characters that you do not actively hate.','2019-04-06',10,4),(156,'This was a sorry excuse for a transformer Movie. This movie was so slow I fell asleep for 45 minutes and didn\'t miss a thing. So after I took the time watch whole thing after I woke up. This movie should not have been called Bumblebee, but it should have been called Charlie. Because this movie was about Charlie and how sad her life has because after losing her father. Their were horribly slow parts of the movie that was either just about Charlie laying her heart out to Bumblebee about losing her Dad or even slower parts with Charlie spending one on one time with Memo. The beginning of the movie got me a little excited, as Optimus Prime send Bumblebee off to earth, And then the movie fell apart, dragged on an had little to do with Bumblebee. This movie could have been call Herbie the Love bug. The fight scene at the end picked the movie up a little but not enough for me to have waist what should have been under two hours of my life but because i fell asleep I waist 3 hours of my life watching this franchise continue to struggle to write a really good transformer script with a cool plot. If you didn\'t like the other movies, trust me don\'t waist your time. If you did like the other movies, it not even close to those. Save your money.','2019-04-08',10,5),(157,'This is a very stupid film, made by stupid people, for stupid people. If you are not completely stupid, you will regret the time you wasted on watching this film.','2019-04-19',10,1),(158,'This was definitely the worse film I\'ve seen in a LONG time; possibly the worst film I\'ve EVER seen. I had free passes and felt cheated out of every minute I spent in an theater, which outside of me and the two victims next to me, was completely empty. Did I misread the word ambitious in the Critics Consensus? The characters I believe were meant to be scary were wearing red long johns. I thought this was meant to be a spoof on horror films and I commend Peele for creating the first in that genre that was neither funny, nor scary.','2019-04-07',11,0),(159,'This movie sucked!

The story line was way off. He did better with Get Out! I\'m very disappointed. I expected more. But oh well, maybe next movie he\'ll hit the mark. Thanks for the little entertainment that we got. Five on it and F the police was the most highlight we got. SMH. The acting was terrific though.','2019-04-18',11,3),(161,'I went to see this film with my hopes high since I have read the books multiple times and I absolutely loved them. Well, I got really disappointed. If you have read the books, you\'re going to be really disappointed as well. If you haven\'t, you will not understand the story, since the action is overall really quick, so you don\'t really understand the scenes or why they are even there. It is boring because 90% of the film nothing much different happens, most of the times is just music playing and Tessa and Hardin kissing and making out. The dialogues are weak, they barely even talk, and if they do, is just hi and how are you. Basically, the characters met and 5 seconds later are already declaring eternal love. No sense at all. The storyline is poor and doesn\'t respect the film at all. For me, the film killed the book. I feel like the characters didn\'t show much emotion. Hardin I just didn\'t feel the vibe. He is really superficial and his personality is just neutral.','2019-04-12',12,2),(162,'Well I wasn\'t expecting too much about this movie but I never thought it was this bad, omg it was so creepy to watch mainly their first time!!! What the hell was that? are you ready? and open the condom with the teeth and how can you put a freaking condom with one hand???Before you even start with the excuse you didn\'t read the books YES I read the books and there was essential parts that it should be in the movie, like Hardin forcing Tessa telling Noah that she was with him during the night, or the REAL MOTIVE of the bet, or Landons and Tessas friendship AND the most important thing Tessa thing with Zed!!!! But no, instead you only focus on Tessa and Hardin kissing all movie, constantly looks for each other, her sighs...The movie itself was not worth it to watch because it all happened so fast most of the scenes did not happened in the books... gosh I am going to try to forget that this movie ever happened.','2019-04-11',12,3),(163,'After reading the novel I expected alot from this movie.

All of the actors contribute to the movie with an outstanding acting. On screen Mel Gibson and Sean Penn show strong chemistry between them making the movie even more compelling. The movie was based on the book ,,The Surgeon of Crowthorne\'\' by Simon Winchester. I think that it wasn\'t an easy task to put it on the screen and director has done a very good job. Overall the movie seemed like it was strongly influenced by Mel Gibson.Recommended for movie lovers.','2019-04-18',13,1),(166,'A few years ago I started to wonder if Hollywood creativity is dry? Now, with this epic movie; not in its events, but in its richness on both the human and artistic sides. A representative performance at the highest level. Four characters centered around; the character of Professor James Murray, played by Mel Gibson and his wife Ada Murray, played by Jennifer Ehle and Dr. William Chester Minor, played by Sean Penn and the wife of the murdered Eliza Merrett, played by Natalie Dormer. These personalities were at the top of their artistic representation, not to mention the characterization of the character and the depth of the human dimension of each. I humbly think that this film will enter Oscar 2020 nominations as the best film and another nomination for the best actor performance to Shin Bin.','2019-04-01',13,3),(167,'This is one of those rare stories that makes one enjoy good story telling and acting with depth. Not a silly hollywood film but a true classic. Sean Penn pulls off a spectacular acting job, and Mel Gibson is in his element once again. It would have been interesting to see what the Director had in mind as a final cut without being kicked out, so maybe a Directors cut will happen down the road.

Afterwards things picked up with their escape leading to the fight where we find out whats really going on with the asylum and the psychiatrist in a crazy plot twist that makes things seem hopless. Then in the end another twist where we find that Mr. Glass\' real plan came to fruition. In all the movie kept me entertained with both the detective and action parts, provoked some level of an emotional reaction at the asaylum part, brought back the excitement with more action, left me feeling hopeless near the end, only to spark a flame of hope, and on top of all that managed to do a wonderful job tying the movies together.','2019-04-19',3,6),(178,'I thought that this movie was very good because of the fact that it had me stressed almost the entire time! I was expecting other good reviews when I checked to see its rotten tomatoes, but I\'m surprised that there are a lot of bad reviews! It could be because they compared it to other movies such as Saw or the Cube, and though I have never seen the Cube, I have seen Saw and I do not think the two are very similar. I loved Logan Miller\'s acting and I did feel connected with some of the characters, despite what other reviewers have said. The last 10 minutes or so were not the best, but it did set up for a sequel nicely, and I would definitely see said sequel!','2014-03-14',5,6),(179,'When the trailer came out I wondered how in the world was Tim Burton going to be able to twist this tale to fit his morbid masterworks, but when I finally saw it, I understood. This is the perfect tale of the diaspora that makes up for the racist overtones in the original animated film. The characters are so human that you can understand their every motivation, even though it may sicken you to the point that you laugh cruelly as they get their comeuppance. This isn\'t P.C. by a longshot and as I watched it I could tell that it was not intended for kids; the sarcasm in the dark humor could tell even a five year old that, though the Dumbo character was lovable and cute. The kids in the film did not overstay their welcome. Colin Farrell was sympathetic yet convincingly heroic and Keaton and Devito\'s chemistry looked as if they just came of the set of Batman Returns. Green seemed out of place in the feature though, I would have rather had Helena Bonham Carter any day.','2019-04-10',6,6),(180,'Avengers: Infinity War just might be Marvel\'s greatest achievement yet. Somehow balancing a bunch of characters perfectly, giving us Marvel\'s best villain with Thanos, and gives us the spectacle we\'ve been waiting for and much more.','2019-01-09',7,6),(181,'Okay so this is coming from a woman\'s perspective. I didn\'t like how certain aspects of Carol were erased that were in the comics. Def some times they were trying too hard to be a femnist icon movie. That being said it was enjoyable. Just didn\'t live up to my expectations for a captain marvel movie. But hey you can\'t win em all at least wonder woman was amazing. Those saying she\'s too overpowered clearly didn\'t read any of the comics. She IS overpowered. In the comics too. Would\'ve been a better ending if she\'d touched that guy\'s head (God why can\'t I remember his name for the love of God) and he remembered that he too had had amnesia and had lived a life before kree. Again enjoyable jus doesn\'t live up to what I expect from a marvel movie. Still like brie as an actress. She def put in a lot of hours into physically training for this.','2019-04-16',1,7),(182,'I really really really loved this movie. Honestly, I really really really loved all three movies. This one truly, once again, lived up to all my expectations. It looked beautiful, it was funny ( I cried of laughter at one point), I loved seeing all the characters again. It was just great. In the end, it got quite emotional for me personally. I tried very hard to hold back my tears but I let one slip, so I was happy my 3D glasses helped me cover up my tear filled eyes. I will miss these movies very much and be sure to watch them all again very soon. Just realized that I pretty much only talked about my emotions but I also want to say something about the storyline. I think this movie had one of the best storylines of all three. I witnessed a growth in multiple characters, which is something I really enjoyed. I hated the bad guy, which hasn\'t happen in this trilogy yet, so that\'s pretty great. Loving all these emotions, to be honest. So, if you haven\'t noticed by now, I loved How to Train Your Dragon (all of them) and HIGHLY recommend you watch them all :-)','2019-04-13',2,7),(183,'Infinity War was a perfectly composed movie, with almost every character being fitted beautifully into a couple hours of screenplay. The main character, Thanos, was a fantastic villain, still being hated because of his murderous intentions, we still believe his goals are understandable and still feel sympathy for his sacrifices in finding that goal. Most of the characters were outstanding in their quest of defeating Thanos. The movie still had its flaws, like the character\'s overall ranking of power was completely scrambled and diversified. Many of the characters who were meant to be either weaker or more powerful than one another was reversed. In conclusion, the move was overall fantastic and constructed with care.','2019-04-06',7,7),(184,'Hellboy starts pretty well in the first half, good introduction of the villain, then hellboy and the BPRD, starting with good action and fighting scenes, but as the plot develops the movie begins to decline a lot, even the visual effects are not so different from its predecessor of more than 10 years ago. Although the addition of interesting new characters that we did not see before the completely different approach to hellboy\'s paternal character lacks charisma and there seems to be no chemistry between hellboy and him.There\'s a lot of gore scenes that looks very cool but all of them feels very rushed without giving it the time to build up. The interpretation of David Harbor is very convincing, even his makeup and prosthetics do not look bad at all, he did a very good job, probably the script and the direction in this new take are the problem. In the end it only becomes entertaining and fun moments, but without a doubt the vision of Guillermo del Toro was much more accurate to the characters and folklore that the comics transmitted.','2019-04-12',9,7),(185,'Why haven\'t they been making these kind of Transformers movies from the beginning? Bumblebee is a scaled-down, character-driven family film where the bigger moments re about fitting in, finding your sense of self, and keeping your new alien robot friend hidden from your parents. Set in the late 80s, Hailee Steinfeld (Edge of Seventeen) plays a high school senior dreaming of a life beyond her neighborhood and family. The ticket out is a new car, which just happens to be an Autobot from another planet disguised as a VW beetle. Because Bumblbee had his memory wiped from a fight years earlier, he\'s very childlike and endearing, and the interaction between the big robot and Steinfeld will rekindle more than a few memories for The Iron Giant, E.T., and other classic boy and his dog tales. There\'s a real attention to the characters, big and small, that makes this the best Transformers movie. Not everything has to be about the next world-destroying cataclysm. There\'s plenty of formidable drama in watching a teen girl navigate the world with an unconventional new friend. Director Travis Knight (Kubo and the Two Strings) graduates to the world of live-action with a terrific feel for the visual parameters and material. It helps that Knight gives his film a sense of scale without sacrificing coherency. The camera prefers wider shots and longer takes so the audience can follow the action. The movie also has a sly sense of humor it knows when it call upon, like a highly enjoyable John Cena who is baffled at his government\'s open door policy to evil robot aliens: They have Decepticon in their name. Is that not a red flag to anyone else? This is a well-paced, sweetly heartfelt movie with good humor, good characters, and good action. If this is what happens when you strip Michael Bay from the franchise, then lock him up. Nate\'s Grade B+','2019-03-01',10,7),(186,'The plot is very thought provoking. Unlike most horror movies these days, this film is not a garbage jump scare heavy or-stay up all night terrified-kind of film. A much more thought provoking and overall entertaining film with a nice twist.','2019-04-03',11,7),(187,'I loved the movie. Reading the books and being so in love with them I was SO excited for this movie. If you\'re a true fan of the book then you should seriously just be glad you even have actual characters played out in front of you! You could tell the story was there! There is still so much see and witness from the book and these actors. There is SO much more of the story we love to be told. The books as Tessa & Hardin were written in 2014.. to make it adapt to 2019 there were changes. GOOD changes. And adaptation of the book isn\'t making it exactly like the book itself, it\'s taking bits and pieces (important) pieces and making it into its own! I love the curve they took with the film & I would give anything for them to be able to make sequels! What does it hurt anyone to be supportive of something others are passionate about!? I\'m proud & in love with this film! I\'m angry about people just not being supportive!','2019-03-28',12,7),(188,'Wasn\'t in a rush to see this one with all the press surrounding it. Brie Larson is great, the movie is funny (especially for someone like me who graduated high school the year it\'s based in....best Stan Lee cameo!), and I loved the action. Some good plot twists too. I wasn\'t sure how I\'d feel about captain marvel joining the avengers since I\'m so attached to the cast of already established characters. However after seeing the movie I\'m sure she\'ll be a great addition. Really fun night at the movies!','2019-04-15',1,8),(189,'The final installment of this beautiful and visually stunning trilogy follows Hiccup and his glorious but chaotic utopia of dragons and humans living together. With the new threat of a dragon killer and the need for a new home, he embarks on a quest to find the myth of the Hidden World. The bittersweet conclusion of this great franchise was very emotional and satisfying, focusing on issues of love, family and leadership, and with a score that was as epic as ever and visual effects that were mostly captivating.','2019-04-10',2,8),(190,'In a shameless bid to join the money grab that superhero movies have become, M. Night Shyamalan returns to his previous outing...to close it out? Oh no. He\'s out to start his own superhero universe, his own narrative (Stan Lee did it, so shut up). But first we get to see, to understand, that such...differentness, in the face of what we understand human capabilities to be, is indeed possible. James McAvoy returns with his jaw-dropping turn as a soul with multiple personalities. And I\'m already waiting for whatever may come next.','2019-04-17',3,8),(191,'Escape Room is extremely fun and entertaining. It manages to redesign and adapt modern âescape gamesâ? in many ways. The film captures an astounding journey of each character rather than leave them all to its destination. This makes the emotional connection to this film even stronger as each character has been assessed using flashbacks making the story more interesting. The reality of the danger helps them discover they all share a common connection, opening the door to the mystery of why they are there. This film differs from other survival films (like Saw) as it tries to engage us with an in-depth look into each character and their worst fears. The characters here donâ(TM)t just exist as props for each character is relatable and you find yourself rooting for them, even as they are eliminated one by one. Adam Robitel really ensures to control our feelings towards the film with every scene. The film set out to do its own universe and it was entertaining along the way. The cinematography was remarkable, capturing many angles and making spaces look much bigger than what they really are. The puzzle rooms are well thought and very creative some weren\'t too easy to figure out. The deaths, though not bloody, were gruesome and unpredictable. The plot was great, and the cast is enjoyable as it makes us feel like we were also there with them. This is a great thriller with new unexpected things to come one after another, opening it for more possible sequels to come. Adam Robitelâ(TM)s Escape Room combines elements of survival mystery and psychological thriller to create a mellow approach of horror film suitable for all regular horror fans. This is a thriller film that will make you feel as if you are trying to escape for your life, while looking forward for more franchise of this genre.','2019-02-21',5,8),(192,'It\'s a kid\'s movie! Adult reviews don\'t really matter. I asked my girlfriend\'s 8 year old daughter what she thought of it: she liked it! Her favorite part: When Dumbo flew. She never saw the original so it doesn\'t matter if it was better or not. Personally, I thought it was a tad overlong but Danny DeVito was great. But, then again, my opinion doesn\'t count.','2019-04-09',6,8),(193,'First the Good. As usual excellent action sequences, excellent graphics and fast paced. James Brolin is perfect as Thanos, probably the most interesting character in this movie. Ruthless, Brooding, Plodding and Self confident. He acts as if no one is his equal. The first scene in the movie is the best. Even with just a silhouette, he appears stronger than anyone in that scene and then what he does. Second best scene would be the Forge Stormbreaker scene. Beautifully done to show where Mjolnir was forged and how Thor gets his new weapon. And the scene where Stark is losing Spidey (Holland). Wakanda scenes are good and enjoyable. Rest of the scenes are done well. Now, the quibbles. Story needs to be more robust, and/or a bit of tweaking. I know, I know, everybody is a screenwriter, so I won\'t mention any story ideas which I do have. But basically its Thanos\' quest for the infinity stones and what he does with it. Give him something to worry about. Also, some of the jokes may come at the wrong time... After Peter Quill and group found Thor, don\'t have him joke around.. he just lost everything.. Thor opens up to Rocket, but not until a few scenes later. I can go on and on.. but hey, everybody is a critic. Bottom line.. good and enjoyable movie..','2019-04-07',7,8),(194,'There was only really one thing that bugged me about this film; the critic reviews! Don\'t listen to all of the critics! I had a lot of fun during this film, and right off the bat, you know that this is going to be a very different version of Hellboy. Don\'t get me wrong, I loved the Guillermo Del Torro movies, but they just weren\'t the Hellboy that I had read about in the comics. The tone and characterization in Del Torro\'s films were nothing like in the comics. They were good, but just not what I was looking for. I was in for a pleasant surprise for this film. By the end of the very first scene portraying David Harbor\'s Hellboy, I felt so relieved. It was such a fresh wonderful take on the character and felt so much more like the character I had read about in the comics. Yes, he had a bit of a deadpanned dry humor, which I really liked, but the core of the character was a lot more pure than the previous Ron Pearlman adaption. I loved Ron Pearlman as Hellboy, but he was a lot more arrogant and rude than how the character was in the comics. I was relieved and overjoyed to finally see David Harbor do complete justice to the character in the comics. The same goes for Ben Daimino. He was still his charming, roughly arrogant character from the comics, and I couldn\'t help but love to finally see Daimino on the big screen alongside Hellboy. Everything Daimino did in the movie, I could see him doing it in the comics too. They didn\'t try to tone down Ben Daimino\'s rough personality that he had in the books, while still managing to give him a noticeable character arc. Alice was a very interesting twist on the character I had loved in the comics. Normally I would be distasteful to any changes in the characters, but I really loved this new take on her. She was strong and pivotal to the backstory of one of the villains. I fell in love with the actress quickly and would love to see her in future films. Now, I think it should be understood to younger viewers that this movie is extremely violent and covers very dark concepts. There is gore in almost every scene, and graphic depictions of decapitations, stabbing, dismembering, and certain types of violence I don\'t even know how to put a word to. Dead children are even depicted in a specific scene, clearly being preyed on by the witch, Baba Yaga. They are seen in the background hanging off of meat hooks. There are plenty of scary elements that many younger viewers should be cautioned about. As parents, you should know your children well enough to determine whether they are ready to see this sort of violent film. I believe that even if your child is not affected by violence, they should have the maturity to understand the severity of the actions. Many innocent people are killed, and the villainess craves empathy. These sort of violent scenes and mature topics made me feel sick to my stomach especially in the Baba Yaga scene, and I think that is what the filmmakers might have been aiming for. Truly gruesome things are portrayed in this movie, and certain things should be understood with a mature mindset. Discuss with your kids about what the story might have been telling you about evil. Each villain was evil in their own way. If you are a Christian, it is good to contemplate this. While watching the Baba Yaga scene, I was in awe by how utterly gruesome and evil the character was. My mind wandered to the unimaginable evil of the Devil himself and thought if this witch is this terrifying, morbid, and indescribably grotesque, how much worse can the Devil be? Things like this can be contemplated from the film. As a sort of philosophical person, I actually think that the terrible violence in the film benefitted from this concept. It was the embodiment of utter corruption and horror, though barely scratches the surface of the severity of these actions. I think this was a really good film and personally got a lot from it. I would definitely recommend it to most teens and up.','2019-03-03',9,8),(195,'BIG meets Spider-Man 2 - Good fun, good cast, good villain(s). Had a very Sam Raimi Spider-Man 2 vibe at times, with the horror, cheese, heroic action, etc, which is a good thing. Well written and thought out jokes with set-up and payoff. Really good fun and faithful to the New 5//Rebirth comic books! Lots of DC easter eggs too!','2019-04-15',0,9),(196,'Oh my god you guys! After exactly a month since it\'s official release date, I finally for the first time got to see the grand finale of the series to one of DreamWorks Animation\'s greatest creations, How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World! Let me tell y\'all, what a way to end it! I\'m not going to lie I almost got emotional from beginning to end when I saw this. The animation visually was absolutely spectacular, the characters were still enjoyable and fun to watch just like they were in the old times, voice acting to them was spot on, and the movie itself was certainly memorable. However as for any flaws, the pacing in the movie was quick in the beginning and a little bit everywhere else, and in the end of the movie where the story takes place later in the future Toothless looks like he hasn\'t even aged. Unlike the trailer where we did see him that way, he still looks the same. Also, I am really shocked that TJ Miller didn\'t reprise his role as Tuffnut because I didn\'t notice really a difference in the voice. Overall, I give this movie a 9.25/10! Even though it\'s sad to see this series leave, I assure you that this will never be forgotten and that everything in this series will live in all of your hearts/memories forever! Thank You DreamWorks!','2019-04-05',2,9),(197,'Wow! More a sequel to Split than an end to a trilogy, Glass succeeds in wowing the audience through nearly unseen displays of super powers. M.

Glass, like all comic book movies, suffers from idiotic henchmen syndrome to the point of ruining some of the suspense, without much comic relief in return. The movie\'s real strength is that it starts feeling good to root for the bad guy.... really good.','2019-04-17',3,9),(198,'This is one of the most interesting psychological thriller that made you think what would you do in a situation like this. Each actor made a great acting because you can understand the different difficult situation they pass during their lives, also the especial effects of all the rooms are incredible and even more the ambience is very real and that makes you enjoy more the movie. Something that i did not like was that at the begin they show you a scene that happens at the end and that ruin a little bit the exciting story of the movie. The music was out of context but nevertheless you put more attention on whats is happening in the movie. I think that director made a great job and if you like thriller movies i would really recommend you this movie.','2019-02-15',5,9),(199,'This film is not as bad everybody else thinks.

I understood, I see it\'s a little different from the animated classic. 2 children training him to fly & even their father played by Colin Farrell. To the them it\'s like a miracle. Danny DeVito he reminds me of a similar character he played in Big Fish (2003) & Eva Green who I grew watching her in Daniel Craig\'s 1st James Bond film Casino Royale (2006) does a good job of playing a lady on a flying trapeze.','2019-04-09',6,9),(200,'Amazing, of course, but still not perfect, Marvel!

So obviously as a fan i wanted to see more of the beloved character on the big screen but was surprised to hear that Hellboy would be returning but in a reboot and wouldn\'t be connected to the previous two movies, when we got more information like Hellboy would be played by David Harbour which is an actor i really enjoy to watch and is great in Stranger Things i was warming up to it and also that it would lean towards a more gritty comic like approach it made me excited. Skipping ahead to when it was releasing i had seen the first trailer (didn\'t like the tone) and the more recent trailers (liked the new trailers which showed the movie off better) i was hyped but the problem arose when i saw the review embargo didn\'t lift till basically release day and then when the reviews did drop it got destroyed with negative reviews and hate (mostly being that it isn\'t Del Toro\'s Hellboy) i put my expectations in check and went into the movie and enjoyed the hell (no pun intended) out of it, thought the action was awesome, the characters to be solid for the most part and the biggest part is Hellboy which was played perfectly by David Harbour. The plot wasn\'t the greatest and the score/ song choices were iffy but it was a fun and enjoyable fresh start to Hellboy.

The action packed comedy really fits well with the story. Also, all of the actors performances were outstanding! Zachary Levi was really good at acting like a 14 (basically 15) year-old boy. Asher Angel, Jack Dylan Grazer, Mark Strong and especially the performances of the foster kids really brought out the best of the movie. Also SPOILERS from now on: When the foster kids turned into more Shazams, my brain imploded with joy and happiness and bursted it throughout my soul. Truly an awesome film to watch and recommend that every person should watch! It\'s literally suitable for anyone (except people who don\'t like mild swearing). The only thing I\'d say would make the film more awesome would be if there was a cameo by Dwayne \'the Rock\' Johnson at the end, then I would have been thrilled but I understand why you didn\'t include him was because you want to build up the hype for the BLACK ADAM movie coming out in 2020 (I think??).

Brie Larson\'s leading performance as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel was stupendous she was funny, serious, and awesome. Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, and Lashana Lynch also gave fantastic performances. I loved Goose the cat aka Goose the Flerken he was cute and awesome. The visual effects were spectacularly incredible especially the de-aging of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury and Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson, all of Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel\'s powers, and Goose the cat when he used his abilities as a Flerken. The makeup and hair styling was terrific especially on the Skrulls. The costume designs were amazing especially Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel\'s.

Not because I haven\'t wanted to, it\'s just been difficult to find one in my area. I know have a center in my mall that offers it and now intend on going to it, especially after seeing this movie. That may sound crazy but solving puzzles and using your mind is a fun experience. Just like this movie. Escape Room was a movie that came out of nowhere. I had no idea about this film until a TV spot appeared during a football game I was watching. I found myself really interested in this film. After an opening that will send us back weeks earlier, we are introduced to almost all of our escapees receiving mysterious puzzles boxes that reveal an address to a building where a exclusive escape room they are being invited to attend. They are all under the impression that this invite was sent to them from people they know. We immediately get bad vibes to this however because of the mysterious greeter asking for their phones not to be used in the room. I was getting Belko Experiment vibes from this at this point and that is not a bad thing. I liked that movie quite a bit. The building design, at least from the outside and lobby look much like the belko building. The set design of all the escape room is very well done. This film is far from done on the cheap then you would expect. With a budget of just over 9 million dollars, every penny is shown with creativeness of the rooms.The film doesn\'t feature any big name actors except for Taylor Russell from Netflix Lost in Space and Deborah Ann Woll from HBO\'s True Blood. That is not to say we are getting low end actors here though. Every performance is well done. Taylor Russell is a very good actress and carries this film. Each room poses a new problem and none of it seems repetitive. With each new mystery comes new challenges and inattentiveness. I have heard some people complain that this has too much of a Saw vibe. I disagree. Yes, the struggle to solve a puzzle before death is similar but not in the same way. I am so sick and tired of similarities always being brought up because of this. All movies share in common things with other films. Does that mean that every film should be accused of this? I don\'t think so. Each room brings intense moments with not knowing which character is going to die or experience bodily harm. This all leads to a interesting final act that I did not anticipate. In fact, Jason Kobasic and I were both feeling like this film could be connected to Belko Experiment and I would have been OK with that. There is a lot of franchise potential in this but only if that characters that survive this film are brought back into it. I am tired of sequels to these kind of movies that just bring in new people every film and ignore the previous characters or just kill them off. The ending did frustrate me at first up until I read an article with the film\'s director saying that sequels want to get made if the box office is good. Well, I am happy to report that the film has already made 64 million dollars worldwide. Be ready people, another trip to the escape room is coming and I am ready for it.','2019-01-28',5,10),(206,'Very interesting film.

Colin Farrell was incredible, Danny was Danny. I was a little disappointed with Keaton... the most disappointing aspect of the film unfortunately was Nicole Parker, Holt\'s daughter who has essentially a very important staring role in the film... very robotic and didn\'t help or pass on any of the emotion that was brewing underneath the rest of the characters and story...If you are looking for a remake of the original Dumbo you clearly will not find that here, this is a new, strange Burton flick.

Even though his plan is monstrous (and based on the stupid overpopulation myth), you understand his motives and even feel for him at the lengths his is willing to go to accomplish his mission (which are horrifying). Behind the camera, the Russos manage to balance the numerous characters and plot lines into an exciting epic, bouncing from New York to Wakanda to even outer space. They match up the characters perfectly, from Iron Man & Dr. Strange to Rocket & Thor, giving the right level of heart between the epic action, which sets a new standard for blockbuster movies.

Then I read those reviews and realized that they were mostly comparing the film to del Toro and Pearlman\'s Hellboy, which, if you are a fan or even a casual reader of the comics, is a bit watered down, but still pretty good. This film was very much a METAL movie. Like hard metal. There is a lot of violence and a bit of gore, but I\'m usually gore squeamish (won\'t watch any SAW movies, but I do enjoy horror) and it didn\'t bother me any because it doesn\'t linger on it. This movie is also very much a movie for fans of Hellboy from the comics. The film mostly suffers from some pacing issues. Things happen a bit quickly, not leaving much time for development and felt a bit like they had enough content they could do a mini series if they wanted. (Which I would love.) However, the sped up pacing did not detract from the film. Most people are going to complain because there is a LOT of violence and gore in the film and it certainly isn\'t a movie for kids. It is very much a movie for adults, those who like metal, and those who are fans of Hellboy.','2019-04-04',9,11),(215,'With a new direction, perspective from a new director, this installment proves to be the best of the bunch, taking place in the 80\'s giving Bumblebee a new set of character development and its human comrade with great execution, and a balance of action and a simple story with a gratifying conclusion. Bumblebee proves to be enjoyable towards its target audience','2019-02-21',10,11),(216,'Us is going to be one of the best movies of the year. It\'s truly scary and not jump scares either. The story is bats*** crazy , Lupita Nyong\'o is amazing , the tone is dark , and the movie is just amazing.','2019-03-27',11,11),(217,'This film is for real cinema lovers, who dont need special effects and flashing images to get excited. I had no expectations when I sat down to view this amazing piece of work. The acting was superb, period costumes on point, casting down to the children, the broadmoor guards all wonderful. Sean Penn deserves an oscar for this extraordinary performance.','2019-04-13',13,6),(218,'1. Visually. From the very first moments of the film, my mouth was hanging open. I mean, what the hell? Nothing looks this good. I have no idea how they made the cars look so much like real cars, and STILL make them look so much like characters. And the settings? Having grown up and traveled all over the South West United States (including more than one pilgrimage down Route 66) They captured, not only the visuals, but the atmosphere and character America\'s Main Street Perfectly. Frankly, if you put real actors in many of the scenes, you wouldn\'t realize it was computer generated you know, if the landscape wasn\'t made up of old car parts.','2019-04-13',14,6),(219,'This is one of those rare stories that makes one enjoy good story telling and acting with depth. Not a silly hollywood film but a true classic. Sean Penn pulls off a spectacular acting job, and Mel Gibson is in his element once again. It would have been interesting to see what the Director had in mind as a final cut without being kicked out, so maybe a Directors cut will happen down the road. Regardless of the legal aspects, it still is a wonderful film especially about a subject that could have easily been rather dull by any other creative team.','2019-04-13',13,8),(220,'I thought the story looked very lame from previews, and the concept didn\'t appeal to me. But when I saw an early screening I was surprised, it was well written and well executed. They didn\'t overload the movie with automotive jokes, which I think would have hurt the story and character development. Owen Wilson\'s voice is great for his role. Overall, it\'s on par with other Pixar films, even if it may not be their best so far. The animation is superb, definitely the best they\'ve done. Giving something like cars distinct personality and characterization seems like it would be pretty tough, and they do a great job with it. See this movie the day it opens.','2019-04-13',14,8),(221,'A few years ago I started to wonder if Hollywood creativity is dry? Now, with this epic movie; not in its events, but in its richness on both the human and artistic sides. A representative performance at the highest level. Four characters centered around; the character of Professor James Murray, played by Mel Gibson and his wife Ada Murray, played by Jennifer Ehle and Dr. William Chester Minor, played by Sean Penn and the wife of the murdered Eliza Merrett, played by Natalie Dormer. These personalities were at the top of their artistic representation, not to mention the characterization of the character and the depth of the human dimension of each. I humbly think that this film will enter Oscar 2020 nominations as the best film and another nomination for the best actor performance to Shin Bin.','2019-04-13',13,9),(222,'Animated films are not my favorite genre and I am not a Nascar fan. I anticipated that I would reflect on the 2 hours in a movie theater as quality family time rather than quality entertainment but this movie had me hooked from the beginning. My kids did not have my background to understand Route 66 history but they didn\'t need it. The loved the film for other reasons. I lived in small towns where a day is fueled with hope of what might come over the horizon. I have actually been cow tipping and laughed at the tractor scenes. I really appreciate the part of the theme of a successful member of a younger generation listening to and profiting by the wisdom of someone older. Far too many children\'s shows revolve around a plot with stupid adults and the youth needing to save the world. This film perhaps restored, for me, a little faith in our entertainment industry. This is one movie the whole family really can enjoy. See this movie if for no other reason than to support the production of this type of message.','2019-04-13',14,9);
